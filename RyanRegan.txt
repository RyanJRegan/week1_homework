Name: Ryan James 

Expectation: I'd really like to get a very good handle of using git, and some additional experience with Ruby. I have devised a small project to start using in my daily routine/server to help me familiarize myself with utilizing github and to see what I can accomplish with crowdsourcing this. 

Occupation: I am a tech support rep for Braintree, now owned by PayPal.

Interesting Fact: I worked at Brookfield Zoo for 5 years, during the last two of which I ran a study on warthog behavior which involved me sitting in total silence for four hours a day, careful not to make my presence known whatsoever as three of the four warthogs there hated me with an undying passion. Interestingly the fourth warthog would let me scratch her belly and was otherwise very polite. Her name was Penny.
